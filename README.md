# multilex: **Multi**lingual **lex**ical assessment using online surveys

Stablish reproducible workflows for assessing lexical development online using [formR](https://formr.org/). This package extends the functionalities of formr (see `formr` [repository](https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr)) to ease the standardisation of online vocabulary checklists used by developmental psychologists. This package covers two functions: the creation of surveys from Excel/CSV/TSV files, and the retrieval and preprocessing of data. A key motivation for this package is that all of these actions can be performed from the same R session, increasing the reproducibility of the workflow.
